<h1><a name="top">About Walmart listings (9/15/2014)</a></h1>

As of 9/15/2014, Walmart has completed turning on EMV at 97% of its locations in the US. Because of this,
I've gone ahead and added all Walmart locations that have not already been added to the map. However, this
means that around 125 or so locations have not been turned on yet. Hopefully those remaining ones will be
turned on before the end of the year, but please keep this in mind when visiting your local Walmart location.
