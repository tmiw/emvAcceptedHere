<h1><a name="news20150226">Sample receipts available (2/26/2015)</a></h1>

<p>I've put up a page with sample terminal receipts <a href="/sample_receipts">here</a>.
This will allow one to figure out the terminal that was used for a particular transaction,
especially since it appears likely that cards will still be taken away from cardholders
for some transactions (namely restaurants). If you have a receipt to contribute,
please PM the mods at /r/chipcards and it will be added.</p>

<h1><a name="news20141024">Merchant Consumer Exchange listings (10/24/2014)</a></h1>

<p>Merchant Consumer Exchange is a consortium of retail businesses comprising of
approximately 20% of US retail spending. They have all agreed to disable security
enhancing technologies such as Apple Pay in favor of their own QR code based
mobile payment solution (called <a href="http://www.currentc.com/">CurrentC</a>), 
which they claim is more secure. In reality, their real motivations for doing so are 
two-fold:</p>

<ol>
<li>To avoid having to pay merchant fees, assuming a significant portion of consumers use 
it instead of credit or debit cards.</li>
<li>To ensure that they can still mine purchases and track consumers for advertising and other purposes,
something that the tokenization technology in Apple Pay thwarts.</li>
</ol>

<p>To that end, <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1807917">they 
have disabled NFC support at their retail stores</a> and are doing everything possible
to prevent progress in payment security. <b>These locations are now in red on the map.</b> 
Please prefer non-MCX merchants if at all possible. They are still on the map because
they do support contact EMV, so they will not be removed at this time.</p>

<h1><a name="news20140929">Diners Club now accepting new US applicants (9/29/2014)</a></h1>

Not strictly about this website, but <a href="http://dinersclubus.com/">Diners Club</a> is
accepting applications again. Supposedly it's a true chip and PIN card (with PIN priority),
but we'll see when mine arrives in the mail.

<h1><a name="news20140915">About Walmart listings (9/15/2014)</a></h1>

As of 9/15/2014, Walmart has completed turning on EMV at 97% of its locations in the US. Because of this,
I've gone ahead and added all Walmart locations that have not already been added to the map. However, this
means that around 125 or so locations have not been turned on yet. Hopefully those remaining ones will be
turned on before the end of the year, but please keep this in mind when visiting your local Walmart location.
