<h1><a name="top">Merchant Consumer Exchange</a></h1>

<p>Merchant Consumer Exchange is a consortium of retail businesses comprising of
approximately 20% of US retail spending. They have all agreed to disable security
enhancing technologies such as Apple Pay in favor of their own QR code based
mobile payment solution (called <a href="http://www.currentc.com/">CurrentC</a>), 
which they claim is more secure. In reality, their real motivations for doing so are 
two-fold:</p>

<ol>
<li>To avoid having to pay merchant fees, assuming a significant portion of consumers use 
it instead of credit or debit cards.</li>
<li>To ensure that they can still mine purchases and track consumers for advertising and other purposes,
something that the tokenization technology in Apple Pay thwarts.</li>
</ol>

<p><strike>To that end, <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1807917">they 
have disabled NFC support at their retail stores</a> and are doing everything possible
to prevent progress in payment security. <b>These locations are now in red on the map.</b> 
Please prefer non-MCX merchants if at all possible. They are still on the map because
they do support contact EMV, so they will not be removed at this time.</strike></p>
