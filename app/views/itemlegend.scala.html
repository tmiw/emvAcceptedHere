<h1><a name="pin">PIN pad</a></h1>

<p>"PIN pad" means that there is a customer-facing device with a PIN pad. 
Businesses with only a merchant facing terminal but that pass the terminal to 
the customer for PIN preferring chip cards do not count despite allowing PIN
entry. Businesses without this checked have a higher probability of acceptance
issues with PIN preferring cards due to many of them having poor terminal positioning.</p>

<h1><a name="contactless">Apple/Android Pay</a></h1>

<p>If this is checked, the business has a terminal that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Has NFC/contactless hardware built in,</li>
<li>Has said hardware enabled, and</li>
<li>Allows use of said hardware by customers.</li>
</ol>

<p>Due to poor terminal positioning and training, many smaller businesses satisfy (1) and
(2) but do not satisfy (3), in effect meaning that they do not accept contactless payment.</p>

<h1><a name="gas">Works at the pump (gas stations only)</a></h1>

<p>If this is checked, gas pumps at the listed service station enforce the service code
on a chip-enabled card and require that the chip be used. This will likely manifest itself
as being required to re-insert the card or not show any "remove card quickly" or similar 
prompts after insertion. Receipts will also print a line showing the card's AID.</p>

<h1><a name="payattable">Has pay at the table (restaurants only)</a></h1>

<p>If this is checked, payment was performed by the server or by the customer using
a device located at or brought to the table. This is usually accomplished by Ziosk tablets or
similar at every table or by a device carried by the server such as
<a href="https://www.clover.com/get-paid/mobile" target="_blank">Clover Mobile</a> and the 
<a href="https://ingenico.us/smart-terminals/wireless-terminals" target="_blank">Ingenico iWL series</a>.
